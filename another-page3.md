# Introduction

Since the emergence of the internet in the early 1990s, the prospects of electronic democracy have been thought of as heralding the arrival of a new era of political and civic participation (Freeman and Quirke, 2013). Following the popularization of digital services in the 21st century, public engagement platforms are becoming increasingly common among local governments. Through improved user experience, increased transparency, public communication, and internal data visualisation and graphical documents, governments and organisation seek to better engagement practices and design principles to achieve the goal of governance (Gerding 2018). Users as practitioners/citizens/producers are civic engagement platforms' main content which need them to engage in digital decision-making, governance, proposition, etc.) in the digital service movement. Civic engagement refers to activities of individual actions based on personal interest in and attention to politics and societal issues or collective actions voluntary work of collective forms to improve conditions in the local community, for charity, or to help others (Ekman and Amnå, 2012, p.292). Infusing design is to achieve more active civic engagement. 

The purpose of such activities is to improve life condition of oneself or others (Adler and Goggin, 2004). Like the platform “Leeds Street for All”, online civic engagement platforms can provide new opportunities for the public to express views and insights, consider the views of others, assist in identifying innovative ideas and new approaches to public policy issues, and directly engage with government. With the help of civic engagement, Leeds City Council has completed a number of important projects such as the Elland Road Park & Ride project in 2018 which received 92 proposals and 121 praises through the civic engagement platform and the Dyneley Arms Junction project in 2019 which received 209 proposals 309 praises. The 2023 Armley, Bramley and Stanningley, Kirkstall project received 886 suggestions and 347 praises. 2024 Adel and Wharfedale, Guiseley and Rawdon, Horsforth, Otley and Yeadon received 960 suggestions and 355 endorsements. In terms of the population base and the actual delivery of the project, there is substantial space for improvement in the effectiveness of citizen engagement. Based on this, the experience and effectiveness of engagement can be enhanced by further improving citizen motivation and capacity through information and service design. There is a large amount of reasonable and effective information contributed that is wasted due to without being designed, not to be valued by the government and referenced by other participants; and many people who are interested in participating lose their motivation to do so because of the lack of design in the service process. Information and services do not fulfil the positive role of prompts as a means of increasing motivation and capacity for participatory behaviour.

By civic engagement platforms (as tools), citizens can connect with and interact with government, representatives, or public administration, participate in discussions, and access resources conducive to making well-informed decisions, thus enhancing their involvement in local democratic processes and reduce digital divide (Filippi et al., 2020). These platforms seek seamless communication, collaboration, and involvement in decision-making processes, thereby fostering greater transparency and democracy within society, which creates new needs for design. The fact that most platforms are currently seen to be using homogenised methods doesn’t mean that they are genuine participation (Segalowitz and Chamorro‐Koc, 2018). As traditional offline citizen participation methods, we normally find a general lack of interest, which leads to small groups influencing participatory measures and the proposed electronic participation methods (such as online deliberation) have not addressed the issue of involving people in the governance process (Bohman, 2018). This resulted in most of the local governments adopting online measures not achieving citizen participation that is considered meaningful (Norris and Reddick, 2013). It wastes a lot of public resources. This thesis starts from the behavior of engagement and from the nature of engagement, using design to change approaches and shape of engagement. 
It should be noted that many survey questionnaires initiated by business and commercial participation activities are not within the scope of the study. These activities are usually carried out for commercial purposes, such as surveys of certain products, promotion activities, and ‘voting for your favorite film’. These commercial activities do not involve in social decision-making, and citizens' participation does not help to improve their community or life environment. This thesis objectes the contribution of citizens' actual participation in social decision-making, and develop a framework for the systematic design strategies.

This research understands and studies the relationship between citizen participation behavior and information/service design from the perspective of the MAP (Motivation, Ability, Prompts) behavior model proposed by Fogg (2019, 2009). The target behavior like online participating has three factors to perform: ability, motivation, and prompts (Fogg, 2019; Fogg and Euchner, 2009). Firstly, Preece (2016) pointed out that considering how to involve participants in the design process (not only participating in the existing participation functions of the platform, but also supported by parameterised patterns and modules, as discussed in the following section that true participation should include decision-making contributions), various aspects of development, especially making creative contributions to the experience, requires understanding the motivations of civic that they are willing to engage. This willingness/motivation/need is the driving force behind participation behavior. Secondly, for users to actively participate and enhance their ability to participate, it is necessary to provide and design information that is accurate, up-to-date, reliable and easy to understand (Parush, 2019). The evaluation of the information design usually also considers participation, experience, and clarity of communication (Jeanne-Louise, 2017). For example, lengthy texts can be difficult and boring for the audience, the improvement is to use simple graphics to replace it, thereby reducing cognitive burdens (Rossi and Lenzini, 2020). The simplicity of information design becomes a scarce resource, indirectly enhancing the abilities of participants (Fogg, 2024c) through the empowerment of information design. Then, the information/service design as prompts for active motivation and empowerment in participation. This mainly refers to the information types that match the context to best combine motivation and ability (Fogg, 2024d). Finally, before delving into the issue of participation as a wicked problem for further discussion, it can be assumed that the lack of these three factors (Motivation, Ability, Prompts) leads to failure of participation then the current civic engagement platform issues. Thus, solutions are attempted to add action content, paths, and goals that generate substantial participation contributions on existing participation behaviors, for forming new organisations and service processes.

Excepting for the online citizen participation platform as the research background and the participation behavior as the research object, at the logical level of design, this paper takes information design and its extension research (such as experience design) as the frontend content (visualised, mainly visualisation following organization), service design as backend content (unvisualised, mainly organisation following visualization). The intersection is the main research topic, to form a theoretical framework and practical guidance and solve the problems that arise from the research object in the scene (research background). The specifics about the framework are explained later.
Also, participatory design (PD) is interspersed because of participatory method in services and products in the following theoretical studies. In this framework, design is the intentionality of a intervention or civic action (Gordon and Mihailidis, 2016, p.20) that is about understanding the purpose of behaviors and decisions. The research framework could be called the "intentionality" framework, which aims to indirectly convey the intentionality of design to participants through information and services for forming a better experience that motivates participation while reflecting design principles and design needs.
