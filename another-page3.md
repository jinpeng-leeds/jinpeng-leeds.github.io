# Abstract

This project delves into the visualisation and organisation of information design with the aim of bolstering social engagement to support decision-making for societal and governance objectives.

The study presents innovative contributions by constructing a novel design framework that centers on information-driven design and user experience (UX), which encompasses quantitative assessment of engagement behavior and parametric models for participatory design. The work also underscores the transfer of relevant knowledge from design practices to the domain of design science research (DSR). Notably, contributions imply the potential to entrust the rights and interests of social design to citizens, thereby lowering the barriers to effective citizen participation.

The central tenets of research revolve around the visual and organisational methods employed in shaping the incentive process through information elements, and emphasize the effectiveness and optimization of these forms. Information components are regarded as states and groups to derive meaningful patterns and modules that underpin the development of design models. Facilitating this process through appropriate labeling and dynamic parameter sets achieves effective incentives, ultimately reducing the barriers associated with participatory design in the realm of information.

The research methodology involves the utilization of systemic design toolkits to support a closed-loop approach. Leveraging quantitative tools based on case studies and reliable sources, the study evaluates engagement behavior comprehensively. Subsequently, projects employ parameterization models to experiment and analyze the feasibility of various approaches. Through iterative testing and comparative analyses, aims endeavor to identify optimal or improved visualisation solutions.
