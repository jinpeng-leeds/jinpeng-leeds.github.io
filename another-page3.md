# Introduction

This project delves into the visualisation and organisation of information design with the aim of bolstering social engagement to support decision-making for societal and governance objectives.

Based on study and design participation (hydrological/public safety/urban traffic/et al.) platforms in which citizens can deeply engage, the research builds a new design framework centred on information design (ID) and user experience (UX). Participants use new parametric and visual design toolkits to engage in online platform buildings and specific participation works, while quantitatively evaluating the initiation and effects of participation, in order to make substantive contributions to public decision-making, motivation, and incentives. Current information and UX design research focus on methods and relevant processes (gamification, modeling) and outcomes (quantification and evaluation) while neglecting how to naturally waken and initiate relevant activities and actions. The central tenets of research revolve around the visual and organisational methods employed in shaping this kind of evocation through information elements, and emphasize the effectiveness and optimization of these designs. Notably, these works imply the possibility of delegating the rights and benefits to citizens, lowering the barriers to effective engaging actions in distributed and decentralised contexts, and encouraging the potential social energy through design.
