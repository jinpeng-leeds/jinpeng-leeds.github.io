# Abstract

This research project explores the visualisation and organisation of the information design about how to drive social engagement, for supporting decision-making to achieve society and governance goals.

Original contributions advance an innovative design framework related to information-driven design and UX, which includes quantifications assessment of participation behavior, and parametric model of participatory design. The work further promotes relative research transferring from design to design science. Contributions also imply possibilities and evidence that the rights and interests of social design are entrusted to citizens, which means lower barriers to accomplishing positive citizen participation.

The research argues core points are the visual and organized methods of information elements pushing incentive process, and making sure these forms are effective and optimizing them. The information parts are viewed as states and groups to make sense. Therefore derive patterns and modules creating design models. As helping via label and dynamic parameter sets, the process of incentive would be accomplished and the barrier of participatory design related to information would be lower than the current methods.

The methodology is to use innovative design toolkits to argue closed-loopy. When the quantify tool (based on cases and sources) evaluating the engagement behavior is fully supported, the feasibility data imports the parameterizing model（tool）to experiment and analyze. Through testing and comparing repeatedly, obtain optimal or improved (visualization) solutions.
