# Foundational Analysis of Information Design and Design Science

_The article is based on Dr. Alan Hevner's series of research_

*Design Science in Information Systems Research*

Two paradigms crucial to acquiring knowledge in the Information Systems field: behavioral science and design science.

*Behavioral Science Paradigm* Roots in natural science research methods, focuses on developing theories that explain and predict organizational and human phenomena related to the analysis, design, implementation, management, and use of information systems. These theories inform researchers and practitioners about the interactions among people, technology, and organizations necessary for effective information system outcomes. They influence design decisions, including the system development methodology and functional capabilities, information content, and human interfaces.

*Design Science Paradigm* This paradigm, with roots in engineering and artificial sciences, is a problem-solving approach that aims to create innovations, defining concepts, practices, technical capabilities, and products for the effective and efficient execution of information systems. These artifacts rely on existing theories but often extend beyond them, requiring creative advances, as technology is applied in new areas. Design is recognized as a complex but essential aspect of Information Systems research, as it extends the boundaries of problem-solving and organizational capabilities.

Designing useful artifacts in the Information Systems field is essential for solving complex problems and are applicable in various domains.
