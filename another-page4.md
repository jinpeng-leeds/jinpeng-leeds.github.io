# Foundational Analysis of Information Design and Design Science

_The article is based on Dr. Alan Hevner's series of research_

**_Design Science in Information Systems Research(2004)_**

Two paradigms crucial to acquiring knowledge in the Information Systems field: behavioral science and design science.

**_Behavioral Science Paradigm_** 
Roots in natural science research methods, focuses on developing theories that explain and predict organizational and human phenomena related to the analysis, design, implementation, management, and use of information systems. These theories inform researchers and practitioners about the interactions among people, technology, and organizations necessary for effective information system outcomes. They influence design decisions, including the system development methodology and functional capabilities, information content, and human interfaces.

**_Design Science_**
This paradigm, with roots in engineering and artificial sciences, is a problem-solving approach that aims to create innovations, defining concepts, practices, technical capabilities, and products for the effective and efficient execution of information systems. These artifacts rely on existing theories but often extend beyond them, requiring creative advances, as technology is applied in new areas. Design is recognized as a complex but essential aspect of Information Systems research, as it extends the boundaries of problem-solving and organizational capabilities.

Designing useful artifacts in the Information Systems field is essential for solving complex problems and are applicable in various domains.

In the past 20 years, over 200 articles, most research objects have been aimed at designers and developers. From 2016, the direction began to toward the common participators in projects. The function of leading and guiding conducted via designers is also emphasized by Hevner. The strength of citizen design is quite stronger in effectiveness. Designers consider how to motivate the citizens' potential ability to design, which is more worthy than doing design by themselves. This work mixed many kinds of area knowledge in one project as well the same time.

For example：

Patient health locus of control: the design of information systems for patient-provider interactions（2022）

Citizen Data Scientist: A Design Science Research Method for the Conduct of Data Science Projects （2019）

Capturing User Generated Video Content in Online Social Networks （2018）

The information is more closely like the original state of text, image, and graphic organising. The brain of a human is like a computer. The eyes catch and receive the information from out-body then transfer it to the brain and process. People have emotions and feelings. The processing, which is easily influenced by aspects of mental and experience and so on, is different from the machine. That's why the project needs to conduct the experimental simulation. The original sources from informatics science are more suitable than information design. It changes the design methodologies a lot.
