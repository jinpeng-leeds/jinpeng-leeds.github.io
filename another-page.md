# From Offline to Online: Blended and Multimodal Progress

Surveys mode mixed internet, phone, and mail (Dillman et al., 2014).

Online participation offers the advantage of convenience, but it may also lead to a decrease in participant patience. In contrast, individuals typically exhibit greater patience when engaging with traditional paper or other offline media. The online interface introduces an element of uncertainty, making users more inclined to quickly skim through content, potentially missing key information before moving on to the next page. This behavior is often influenced by habitual experiences, as Subramanian (2018) pointed out that online networks tend to foster shorter attention spans in media consumers. This shortened attention span, in turn, contributes to the accelerated pace of social interaction in various aspects of modern life (Firth et al., 2016).
