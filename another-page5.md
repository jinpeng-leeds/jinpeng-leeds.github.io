C[_From Zamani et al_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275123003980)

**A**

Objects: stakeholder within urban planning, interactive session(s)

Aims: choice medium, help to improve the overall approach

Dimension:

Accessibility (Immediate and Unreachable) means the efferts and cost of participants.

Availability (Unrestricted and Closed) means the available space for the participants.

Adequacy (Optimized and Ignored) means suitable ways to encourage the essential ability of public.

Affordability (Valued and Expensive) means public can cover the afford the cost to participate.

Acceptability (Trusted and Cautious) means attitude toward the different medium.

Awarenes (Conscious and Ignorant) means communication strategy and methedologies.

**B**

Objects: Secondary School Students (also available for University/College)

Aims: For Educational and Psychological Practitioners to Better Understand and Address their Students' Motivation and Engagement - and for Researchers to Include Valid and Reliable Measurement in their Research

Motivation Quotients (MQ) Factors:

Adaptive Motivation or Adaptive Cognition includes belief (mastery orientation), value (valuing), learn([self-efficacy](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-volume-III.pdf)).

Adaptive Engagement or Adaptive Behavior includes persist (persistence), manage (task management), plan (planning).

Maladaptive Engagement or Maladaptive Behavior includes diseng (disengagement), sabot ([self-handicapping](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-16422-009)).

Maladaptive Motivation or Maladaptive Cognition includes anxiety, avoid (failure avoidance), control (uncertain control).

_For understanding the MQ Factors, there are four validational correlates to fully explian them_

Engagement (adaptive cognition r= .65/ adaptive behavior r= .58/ maladaptive r=-.20/ maladaptive behavior r=-.65) means tripartite engagement model and includes cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement.

Buoyancy (adaptive cognition r= .31/ adaptive behavior r= .39/ maladaptive r=-.74/ maladaptive behavior r=-.33) meants the ability facing the studying difficulty.

Achievement (adaptive cognition r= .15/ adaptive behavior r= .09/ maladaptive r=-.14/ maladaptive behavior r=-.20) means the actual performance in different courses.

Adaptability meants the ability facing uncertainty and change in the studying process.

**C**

Objects: The Effect on Citizen Participation

Aims: Develop Responsive Smart Cities with Self-organisation Approaches via Citizens' Participation

Online Participation Methods:

Online Platforms

Open Data

Direct Interaction

Living Lab

Citizen Participation

Self-organisation

**Comparing and Final Indicators**

Choose A from three evaluation frameworks as a basic assessment tool to develop. Compared with B, the form is easy-understanding and concise, because it fuses the positive and negative factors into one visualising information chart as a whole skillfully. Model C compares the different online channels and provides quantified methods focusing on relevant references. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) is used. Some references are selected finally.

_Add indicators：Inclusiveness, Labelisation, Attainment (from Achievement), Assistance (from Buoyancy)_

Online participation platforms can ignore economic costs, and participants spend more on time costs. It follows that participants ought to have sufficient willingness and motivation to contribute their time. Therefore the platform should be inclusive and open, rather than limiting users. Some characteristics, like cross-culture and interracial communication, should be included in the design. The description about inclusiveness, as a rapid formative assessment tool, implementing an online participation platform through mobile technology can meet different design dimensions while expanding social inclusiveness, also adapting to various groups, cultures, and ages demands (Roslan, 2021; Splinter et al., 2022), is certainly more suitable for the topic comparing the “affordability”.

In addition, it seems lack of item to match the information structure and statement, ought to evaluate the different kinds of label’s function (labelisation). Various labels allow different information fusions to be created and are convenient for experiments and rapid demo tests. It continually decreases instruments' useless targets from literature analyses, adds new ones, and reflects the sort of methodology.
